# Power BI Survey Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze a survey dataset collected from data professionals to derive meaningful insights. Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistent data types.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to transform raw survey data into actionable insights through comprehensive data visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **CSV**: The format of the raw survey dataset.

## Problem Solved
The project solves the problem of deriving insights from unstructured and raw survey data by cleaning and transforming it into a structured format, followed by creating interactive and insightful visualizations in Power BI.


## Outcome
The project resulted in a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that provides clear, actionable insights into the preferences, experiences, and challenges faced by data professionals. This dashboard aids in better decision-making and strategic planning based on survey responses.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The raw survey data was cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
- **Data Visualization**: Created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the insights from the survey data.
- **Insights and Analysis**: Provided detailed analysis and insights based on the survey responses.
